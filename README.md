# SQL Data Cleaning and EDA: Post-COVID Layoffs (2020 Dataset)

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing the impact of COVID-19 on layoffs using SQL for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, highlights layoff trends during 2020, a year significantly affected by the pandemic. The objective is to uncover meaningful insights, such as the industries most affected, geographic patterns, and other key factors influencing layoffs.

## Key Features  
- **Dataset**: Layoff data from 2020, sourced from Kaggle.  
- **Technologies Used**: SQL (executed in [your platform, e.g., MySQL Workbench, SQLite]).  
- **Scope**:  
  - Data cleaning to handle inconsistencies, duplicates, and missing values.  
  - Exploratory analysis to extract trends and insights.

---

## Key Insights  
1. **Industry Impact**: Identified industries that experienced the highest number of layoffs.  
2. **Geographic Trends**: Analyzed the distribution of layoffs across regions.  
3. **Time Trends**: Monthly layoff trends during the pandemic.  
4. **Company Data**: Highlighted specific companies with notable layoffs.

## Files  
- **SQL Scripts**:  
  - `data_cleaning.sql`: SQL queries for data cleaning.  
  - `eda_queries.sql`: SQL queries for analysis and visualization preparation.  
- **Dataset**: The Kaggle dataset file (not included here; refer to Kaggle for access).  
- **Documentation**: Includes visualizations and a summary report (optional).

## Tools & Setup  
1. **Platform**: [e.g., MySQL Workbench, SQLite].  
2. **Environment**:  
   - SQL database setup.  
   - Kaggle dataset import instructions.  
3. **Requirements**: SQL expertise and basic knowledge of data analysis.

---

## How to Use  
1. Import the dataset into your SQL platform.  
2. Run `data_cleaning.sql` to clean the data.  
3. Execute `eda_queries.sql` to perform exploratory analysis and generate insights.

## Challenges & Learnings  
- **Challenges**: Dealing with incomplete data and ensuring query efficiency.  
- **Learnings**: Improved understanding of data cleaning techniques and SQL analysis skills.

---

## Future Scope  
1. Automate reporting using tools like Tableau or Power BI.  
2. Extend analysis to multiple years for a broader perspective.  
3. Incorporate more datasets to identify global trends.
